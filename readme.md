# Purpose

There are many different ways to configure SD-WAN and VPN tunnels based on your unique goals and objectives. My goal in creating these example configurations was to familiarize myself with how various aspects of Hub-Spoke VPN work with SD-WAN by consolidating the various bits of examples and pieces of documentation I came across listed below in the Resources section. All of this information is publicly available, I just put some things together that worked for me.

## Disclaimer

__*Use at your own risk*__

These example configurations were a learning tool for me to figure out what works for what I was trying to do, what didn't work, and maybe even a little bit as to why. I make no claims that this is the best way, or even the correct way, to configure devices utilizing this technology. What worked for me in a certain situation may not work for you, etc. I encourage you to take the time to learn and try these things out yourself and make your own judgments.
